A nextJS project that use blockchain to store information and connect users

The project is an adventure game with 3 main page

Inventory: displays stats about your accounts

Raids: mechanic for getting points based on certain conditions

Such as: how often that raid is done compared to others, amount of power your item has, and type of item

Crafting: use points to create items that will gain power based on points put in and a random element/type

currently raids give an amount based on weapon strength that is 1:1, then it gets modified based on certain conditions. In the future this would get reduced to slow player growth to help it feel better as a game

raids also currently can just be done whenever, if this wsa gonna be sent out more I may put a timer or something else on it to limit runs to help gamify it more so growth feels more earned and not just spamming a button
